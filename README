Howto run plib-query project on Tomcat
----------------------------------------

=== Prerequesites ===

1. Install a Tomcat Server
See http://tomcat.apache.org/

2. Install maven 2 or maven 3 if not available:
See http://maven.apache.org/

=== Set up ==

1. Clone the sources from bitbucket:
git clone https://ssobek@bitbucket.org/ssobek/plib-query.git plib-query

2. Then you need the oracle jdbc driver. Unfortunately these are not available in public maven repositories.

So download it form the internet by googling or take the 10.2 version from resources directory delivered here. (see /lib/ojdbc6.jar)

Then install it into your local maven repository:
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc14 -Dversion=10.2.0.2.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=lib/ojdbc6.jar

NOTE: The -Dfile path must match the exact jar file otherwise you have no response that something went wrong! Maven will simply install a pom and no jar into your .m2 directory!

3. Now try to build the project:
mvn clean install

If you may have a failure due to test failures, it can be that there are some integration test failures if you do not have a oracle database running.
Ignore that for now:

mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
